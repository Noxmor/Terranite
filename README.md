# Terranite

> [!WARNING]
This mod is still in early development. Therefore, most features will probably not be implemented yet. However, by reading this you can already get a good grasp of what this mod is about.

## The Idea
`Terranite` is a mod designed to take on the idea of `infinite worlds` and ehance the experience for players. So called `infinite worlds` are Minecraft worlds that are meant to be played on forever. However, this playstyle quickly leads to problems. What if a new Minecraft version is releaded? Upgrading a Minecraft world to a newer version can sometimes lead to issues, most likely related to `chunk generation`. What if you have a world that is many years old, therefore a lot of the world is already explored, and now the next Minecraft version introduces a new biome or structure? You will most likely miss out of exploring these new things in your already so old world. `Terranite` is designed to take the burden of the previously mentioned problems and make `infinite worlds` so much more enjoyable.

## The Philosophy
Building and crafting your own world is probably your top priority when playing an `infinite world`. Therefore, the following statements must hold true in `Terranite`:
1. All blocks **must** be farmable
2. Gathering blocks **may** be grindy in accordance to the block's "rarity", but the process of building something **must** feel easy and enjoyable
3. All items **may** be farmable for the sake of completion
4. There are **no** limited resources

## Features
* Recipes for previously uncraftable items/blocks
* A new endgame material: `Terranite`
* Custom enchantments
* Special items for generating biomes, structures, etc.
* Compatibility for JEI

> [!NOTE]
Most features are not yet implemented and more features may be added in the future.

## Recommendation
For the best experience I recommend playing on a `Skyblock` world when using `Terranite`. This avoids the problems related to chunk generation altogether and let's you build your own world from scratch.
> [!NOTE]
In the future `Terranite` **may** include a customized `Skyblock` preset for world generation.
